### API parameters

#### General
- updated-min - timestamp. Seems it's the current Unix epoch time in microseconds (1/1,000,000 second)
- dv - required integer parameter. It seems I can pass any value. I have tried two accounts and this value always the same ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

#### Radio
Request radio/station returns a lot of stuff
- inLibrary is true for station that added to user library
